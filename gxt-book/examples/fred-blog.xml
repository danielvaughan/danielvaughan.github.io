			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the early reports, I think others are more upset about the Gore  separation than they are.  Why?  Because we&#8217;re all looking for people as  role models and marriages as models for how something healthy can last.   And when we discover that people and marriages turn out to have feet  of clay, we feel let down.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you fall in love in your 20s, you&#8217;re swept away by all the  passion.  However you often don&#8217;t know who it is you&#8217;re going to grow up  to be.  And if the two of you grow up to be people who are merely  different and simply not compatible as a married couple, it makes no  sense to make the other person wrong and destroy what was once good.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was told to me by a very wise woman who discovered this with her  first husband.  He agreed and not only did they amicably divorce they  have remained very good friends <em>and</em> successful business  partners.  And because of the cooperation, mutual respect <em>and</em> not making each other wrong, their child has thrived much more than kids  from many conflict ravaged, intact marriages.</p>
<p>I also think that possibly in the case of the Gores ambition can  become a very jealous mistress.  When both partners have a taste of  professional efficacy and success, it is often difficult to keep <em>their</em> personal relationship strong, because each partner is busy relating to  fulfilling their professional aspirations. At that point each person  begins dancing to and even racing towards a different drum.  That may be  the case with the Gores in which Al and Tipper have each enjoyed  separate successes and may be feeling closer to those supporting those  successes than to each other (we will of course be severely disappointed  if we discover that one of those supporting either of them has crossed  over into an affair since the last thing we want to think of the Gores  is that they have descended into the sordid ranks of John Edward/Rielle Hunter).</p>
<p>Ironically it may be that what has kept the Clintons together is that  they have been so supportive of each other&#8217;s professional ambition and  success that their personal/emotional relationship has lost its  importance to either of them.</p>
<p>Another contributing factor might be that the identities of men and  women have spread out to women being much more driven to achieve  professional success than in prior generations.  In the past the man&#8217;s  &#8220;mastery&#8221; in the world didn&#8217;t conflict with the woman being the &#8220;master&#8221;  at home.  In a sense the man was the CEO in the world, the woman was  CEO in the home.  With this division of labor a wife could support her  husband&#8217;s role in the world just as a husband could support his wife&#8217;s  role at home with minimal conflict.  But now with women wanting to have  their own role in the world, you have two CEO&#8217;s trying to work together  at home.  And just as co-CEO&#8217;s rarely survive in the work world, it may  be that they are not surviving at home.</p>
<p>One way to not only survive but thrive in a marriage in which each of  you grow into different personalities is if you share core values to  which your commitment is much more powerful than your personality  incompatibility.  If for instance your love, devotion and commitment to  God or family in your actions vs. words is much more important than  getting your way, there is more than enough room to live happily ever  after regardless of who each of you grow up to be.</p>
<p>If you and your partner are in danger of drifting apart, one great  preventive strategy is to formally schedule a time every month to sit  down with each other and each share what is going on in each other&#8217;s  personal and professional life and in their marriage and family and  where each would like it to go in all those areas and how to each can  help the other.</p>

<strong>A: SEND</strong></p>
<p>-  <a href="http://www.wrslawyers.com/attorneys/roger-goff.asp">Roger Goff</a>, Partner, <a href="http://www.wrslawyers.com/index.asp">Wolf Rifkin Shapiro Schulman and Rabkin LLP</a></p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://musingsbyken.blogspot.com/">Ken McLeod</a>, Executive Director of McLeod &amp; Associates, providing strategic interpersonal consulting for senior executives and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ken-mcleod">Huffington Post</a> blogger:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. When people are sending email, their brains, bodies, and minds are all keyed to interaction not with a person but with a machine, because what they have in front of them is a machine. Thus, they easily say or do things that they would not normally do with a person, including firing off thoughts with thinking. You can yell at a machine without fear of consequences and you can treat a machine unthoughtfully without fear of consequences.</p>
<p>2. The speed of the technology creates a false sense of urgency. People feel that they have to act and react with the same speed of the technology. Thus, instead of taking time to think about a reply (as they would with a letter), they just dash something off as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>3. Closely linked to #2 is anxiety generated by not responding quickly. As emails come in to one&#8217;s inbox, there is a definite sense of relief (probably linked to brain chemistry) connected with disposing of emails: one has responded in the conversation. Thus, hitting the send button is connected with experiencing relief, again, a stimulus for getting them out as quickly as possible.</p></blockquote>

Who allows the protester to burn the flag.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Show me someone who smirks in public<br />
and I&#8217;ll show you someone who rages in private</strong></p>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong>What do Lloyd Blankfein and John McCain and Hillary Clinton have in common?</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When they&#8217;re on the spot and someone is questioning their credibility, they often smirk.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why do they do that?  Like many driven people, Blankfein, McCain and Clinton all have significant narcissistic features to their personalities (I don&#8217;t view any of them as &#8220;dyed in the wool,&#8221; &#8220;through and through&#8221; narcissists).  When the narcissistic part of a personality is affronted or insulted, it feels assaulted and wounded.  That is what is referred to as a &#8220;narcissistic injury.&#8221;  And just as a wounded animal turns its fear into rage to thwart another attack that might prove fatal, a narcissist similarly rages against the offender.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In private that rage can be verbally vicious and even cross over into physical explosions (I am told that prior to his recent mellowing <a href="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.joystiq.com/media/2010/04/ballmer41410.jpg">Steve Ballmer</a>, CEO of Microsoft was a real &#8220;chair thrower&#8221; when he got upset and <a href="http://www.blogoflux.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Steve-Jobs.jpg">Steve Jobs</a> was not far behind him when was displeased) and their wrath is something that their entourages fear.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However when these people are exposed to the spotlight of public scrutiny, they know better than to vent that rage overtly.  Instead they  smile, doing their best to distract from how much they are seething underneath.  To anyone watching, that smile is anything but happy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is often seen as smug, arrogant and condescending.  It may have some of those qualities, but more often it is an effort to sugar coat and distract the viewer away from the narcissistic rage that is bubbling just below.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As such instead of a smirk being seen as &#8220;<a href="http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=-1&amp;msgid=0&amp;act=11111&amp;c=160771&amp;destination=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPassive%25E2%2580%2593aggressive_behavior" target="_blank">passive aggressive</a>&#8221; (i.e. indirectly hostile) it is in actuality more accurately being &#8220;suppressive aggressive&#8221; (i.e. trying to keep a lid on hostility).</p>
<p>If you (or someone you know smirks), because you are feeling affronted or assaulted, something that can help you &#8220;wipe that smirk off your face&#8221; and replace it with a softer, kinder and even loving smile is to stop and &#8220;<a href="http://justlistenthebook.com/" target="_blank">just listen</a>&#8221; to where the other person is truly coming from.  If you do that, you will often discover that they are not trying to condemn you, but are merely trying to deal with their own confusion and fears about something they are looking to you to offer an answer to. </p>
<p>I discovered this many years ago when I was appearing on an Oprah Winfrey show having to do with divorced couples who remarried their ex (at the time I was one of the leading experts in helping divorced couples get back together again via the &#8220;Recoupling <a title="Psychology Today looks at Psychotherapy" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/psychotherapy">Therapy</a>&#8221; I had developed).  When they were putting a microphone on me I looked out at the audience and perceived them as judging me as just another pontificating &#8220;shrink&#8221; and it caused me to have a defensive smile on my face.</p>
<p>Just at that moment, a producer came up to me and told me: &#8220;Dr. Mark, everybody in today&#8217;s audience is divorced and unhappily so.&#8221;</p>
<p>I then thought, &#8220;Wow, they&#8217;re not looking at me to judge me, they&#8217;re looking at me to see if I could help them.&#8221;  Suddenly they went from a lynch mob in my mind to a group of hurting, confused people hoping I might lessen their pain.  And in that moment my <em>defensive</em> smirk turned into a patient, wanting-to-help smile.</p>
<p>And the result? In those days if you won the trust and respect of Oprah, she went to you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD17gGdrsQA" target="_blank">as the final credits ran</a> to answer questions that would summarize the show and offer takeaways to the audience and viewers.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Act 1: Bare Your Bodies</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Oooh, that feels so good!”</strong><br />
-  <strong>he says to her during sex</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Act 2: Bare Your Teeth</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Don’t even think about it!”</strong><br />
-   <strong>she says to him after he has annoyingly reached over and touched her breast after whining and complaining about not having enough sex</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Act 3: Bare Your Necks</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Just breathe though your nose and the pain will all go away.”</strong><br />
-   <strong>she says to him, gently stroking his wrist, after he has been placed on a morphine drip</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Marriages don’t end because you stop loving each other, but because you can’t stop <em>hating</em> each other.  What a tragedy that is, because all it takes is for someone to say, ”I’m sorry, I was wrong and I won’t do that again” and mean it.  Sadly too many people would rather be right than make their relationship better.</p>
<p>The movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY0RAdIZ1Rs">Love Story</a> had it wrong&#8230; &#8220;Love means <em>always</em> having to say (and show) you&#8217;re sorry.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest casualties of the &#8220;connected&#8221; world is that many  parents have lost the ability to connect with their kids.</p>
<p>I  don&#8217;t think parents have lost the &#8220;will&#8221; to connect, guide and teach their children; it&#8217;s that too often they just don&#8217;t know the &#8220;way&#8221; to do it.</p>
<p>Over  the years I have come upon tips that not only help parents connect with  their children, but also help teach them self-reliance and prepare them for life. Here are a few that will help you connect and also teach your  child perspective, perseverance, and patience:<span id="more-2213"></span></p>
<p><strong>Perspective:</strong> The real bedtime story. If you still read a story to your children at  night, add this exercise. Ask them: &#8220;What was the best and worst thing that happened to you today?&#8221; Listen to what they say, and respond with  &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s great&#8221; to the good stuff, and &#8220;Gee, really, I&#8217;m so sorry  you felt upset by that&#8221; to the bad stuff. Don&#8217;t give advice unless they  ask for it. Then ask them: &#8220;What are you most looking forward to  tomorrow and what are you most nervous about? Hear them out the same way  as with the first question. Follow up this exercise by telling your  story. This exercise helps your child develop perspective to see that  both good and bad things happen every day.</p>
<p><strong>Perseverance:</strong> When your children tell you about a situation that has clearly upset,  scared, angered, or hurt them, resist the temptation to quickly reassure  them. Instead, give them a word for what they seem to be feeling by  saying: &#8220;That must have scared/angered/hurt you, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221; If they  agree, calmly ask them: &#8220;How scared/angry/upset, etc. did you feel?&#8221; They may only say, &#8220;Really bad&#8221; or &#8220;Very,&#8221; but in that moment of  saying it to you, they will feel safe, less alone, relieved, and they may even cry. This is a great way of establishing a sense of  comfort and calmness in your children after which they will be more open to suggestions and advice. The formula is: Comfort first, Coach second.  This exercise will help your children develop the ability to comfort and calm themselves when they are older and enable them to persevere through rough times.</p>
<p><strong>Patience:</strong> Do this exercise once a week  with your entire family when you&#8217;re having dinner together. Ask  everyone to talk about something they did in spite of not wanting to do it. You should start the ball rolling. For example, you might say: &#8220;I  went to this meeting I didn&#8217;t want to go to, tried to make the best of it and actually met someone that might help me in my job, and I never would have met that person had I not gone to the meeting.&#8221; Then have  your husband and kids share something. This exercise helps your children  develop tolerance, cooperation skills, and flexibility. It also will  make them accept that people have to do things that they don&#8217;t always  want to do, and because everyone has to do this it&#8217;s fair and part of  life-and having patience when things don&#8217;t go your way works better than  having a tantrum.</p>
<p>These steps do not excuse you from spending a  certain amount of &#8220;face time&#8221; with your children (perhaps equal to the  &#8220;face time&#8221; you need to spend with investors when a telephone call won&#8217;t  suffice) and even experts are not immune from your dilemma.</p>
<p>I  remember years ago when my kids were small. They had a nickname for me:  &#8220;Hi kids, bye kids, love you kids.&#8221; I used to laugh when they would  teasingly taunt me, but then I realized it wasn&#8217;t funny.</p>

Twenty years ago an African native was walking through Manhattan and was asked what he thought about it.  He replied: &#8220;They don&#8217;t see the sky.&#8221;  I think he meant, they&#8217;re all about business and not about building towards something more noble.</p>
<p>If he came back and was asked the same question, I&#8217;m guessing he might reply: &#8220;They don&#8217;t see each other.&#8221;  And I think by that he might mean that everyone is connected, but nobody is connecting.<span id="more-2211"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an exercise to try that is sure to not be interrupted by a surreptitious look at your Blackberry.  Do it with someone you care about, but haven&#8217;t been too connected with lately.  Say to them, &#8220;I have a proposition to make that I need your help with. Might I ask it?&#8221; Hopefully they will agree.  Then say, &#8220;My goal for a year from now is that when we see each other we each put a smile on the other&#8217;s face that touches our hearts.  And when we&#8217;re not together, every time we think of each other, it puts another smile on our face that again touches our hearts. I am willing to do almost anything to make that happen, but need your help in figuring out what to do.  What do you suggest?&#8221;</p>
<p>Shortly after 9/11 and more recently after the financial meltdown.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This may also be naive on my part, but could we agree that most parents love their children? If you don&#8217;t agree then the following will not make sense, but if you do agree, then consider the following as a shared common goal/vision:</p>
<p>&#8220;When our grandchildren are born &#8212; who we assume our children will love as much as we love our children &#8212; they will be born into a world where: a) health care is available to them; b) they will be able to succeed based on merit vs. &#8220;politicking&#8221;; c) they will not have to fear war occurring; d) every year the environment they live in is being restored more than it is taken from.&#8221;<span id="more-2210"></span></p>
<p>If we can agree on such a vision, what do we need to do to make that happen and how shall we manage derailments that knock our mission temporarily off track?<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>(Obama to Hillary Clinton) But the thing is, the economy  is a much bigger mess than we&#8217;d ever imagined it would be, and I&#8217;m gonna  be focused on that for the next two years.  So I need someone as big as  you to do this job.  I need someone I don&#8217;t need to worry about.  I  need someone I can trust implicitly, and you&#8217;re that person.</p>
<p>Hillary raised a matter far more intimate than her personal  reluctance.  <span id="more-2205"></span>You know my husband, she said.  You&#8217;ve seen what happens.   We&#8217;re going to be explaining something he said every other day.  You  know I can&#8217;t control him, and at some point he&#8217;ll be a problem. 	I know, Obama replied.  But I&#8217;m prepared to take that risk.  You&#8217;re  worth it.  Your country needs you.  I need you.  I need you to do  this&#8230;.</p>
<p>It was nearly one o&#8217;clock in the morning on the East Coast.  I don&#8217;t  want this to be your final answer, Obama said quietly an in conclusion.   I want you not to say no to me.  I want you to keep thinking.  I want  you to sleep on it&#8230;.</p>
<p>In Chicago, at the Kluczynski Buildin, Obama walked into Jarrett&#8217;s  office and told her where he was with Clinton.  She said no last night,  Obama reported&#8211;but she&#8217;d called him back that morning.  &#8220;She&#8217;s going to  do it,&#8221; he said&#8230;</p>
<p>It was November 20.  The election was sixteen days in the past.  But  today, Obama had pulled off the grandest game changer of them all.  On  the brink of great power and awesome responsibility, he and Clinton were  on the same team.</p>
<p>(from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Game-Change-Clintons-McCain-Lifetime/dp/0061733636" target="_hplink">Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin  and the Race of a Lifetime</a> by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin  (Harper Collins, $27.95)</p></blockquote>
<p>The Game Change was <em>not</em> merely that Obama got Clinton to join  his team.  It was that after being the grand champion in the  transactional and clearly &#8220;zero sum&#8221; battle to become President, Obama  saw that being President wasn&#8217;t about him or about Clinton, but about  serving the American people who were entrusting their future to him.   And it was because of his awareness of this overwhelming responsibility  and a &#8220;duty bound&#8221; core value to perform it that enabled him to become  vulnerable to Clinton and her to become the same with him.  The Game  Change was Obama&#8217;s baring his neck that inspired her to do the same and  about letting go of winning and replacing it with collaborating to serve  a higher purpose.</p>
<p>This incident brings to mind another game changer when President  Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, the general secretary of the  Communist Party and first executive president of the Soviet Union, met  and were locked in a standstill in attempting to thaw relations between  the US and USSR.  The tipping point to move them towards collaboration  appeared to be when Reagan and Gorbachev possibly realized that neither  were truly &#8220;the evil empire&#8221; and that they were there not because of  themselves, but because of their responsibility to their people.  And it  was perhaps that realization that enabled Reagan to say to Gorbachev:  &#8220;I think the time has come for us to be on a first-name basis. Call me  Ron.&#8221;</p>
<p>What should Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill and locally  take from these examples?  The answer is simple. Realize that your job  is not about you, but about serving the American people who all have in  common fear, confusion and a deep need and desire (under their  skepticism and cynicism) to trust those representing them in Washington  to do the right thing.</p>
<p>To put it simply and bluntly.  The time has come for Republican and  Democrat alike to realize that attacking the other will only result in  both sides becoming further entrenched, resistant to collaboration and  most important, further removed from serving the American people.  Each  party needs the other&#8217;s cooperation to accomplish anything and it might  help them do it if they would just reach across the aisle, as Obama did  with Clinton, and ask for it.</p>
<p>When baring your knuckles and baring your teeth doesn&#8217;t achieve the  results you are seeking, maybe it&#8217;s time to bare your neck.*</p>
