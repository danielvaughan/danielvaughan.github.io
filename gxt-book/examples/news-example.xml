			<title>Pen used to draw complex charts</title>
			<link>http://www.example.com/item570.html</link>

				time. Previously it was impossible for a pen to be used to draw
				complex charts as the line it produced was too fat. Now for the
				first time a pen with a thin enough line has been produced. </description>
