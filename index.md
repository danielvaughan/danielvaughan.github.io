Iâ€™m Daniel Vaughan. I enable teams to deliver business value through software, rapidly and sustainably.

I am currently a Cloud Solutions Expert at HCL Cloud Native Labs in central London where I help organisations plan journeys to cloud native platforms and overcome challenges to adoption. This includes migration and modernisation strategies for existing applications and how to ensure compliance and security requirements are maintained.

My particular interest is the enablement of development and operations teams and how to scale those capabilities. This involves making the best use of new tools, technologies, and the agile and DevSecOps techniques cloud-native platforms enable.

<b>As a developer</b>, I enjoy developing scalable, distributed systems using clean, performant code. I value clear APIs, great documentation and comprehensive testing.

<b>As an architect</b>, I am experienced designing service-oriented, microservice, event-driven and serverless architectures. I value automation and reproducibility with platforms that are efficient to manage. 

<b>As a leader</b>, I build effective user-focused teams that embrace Agile and DevSecOps culture. I value continuous improvement, mentoring and knowledge sharing.

<b>As a consultant</b>, I am equally comfortable having strategic discussions with CxOs as I am discussing technical details with engineers.

Much of my current technical skills were built at the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} in Cambridge, UK where I worked on data submission systems. A highlight of which was being Technical Lead for the Ingestion team of the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org) [Data Coordination Platform](https://www.humancellatlas.org/data-sharing), one of the first projects at the institute to embrace public cloud technologies.

Before that I worked in a variety of software development roles at startups, enterprises and consultancies in a career that started in the late 1990s.
            
I am particularly passionate about community and skills development. I founded the Genome Campus Software Community  and EMBL-EBI Technical Seminars Programme, bringing people together to share their ideas, expertise and perspectives. I still believe that [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com){:target="_blank"} are one of the best ways of building tech communities. Other professional interests include futurism especially around the future of work and automation.
