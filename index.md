## Professional Experience

### Current Role

I currently work as a Director of Software Engineering at [Mastercard](https://www.vocalink.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new window)</span> in London where I am responsible for cloud strategy and architecture for [real-time payment products](https://b2b.mastercard.com/real-time-payments/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new window)</span> as well as building cloud native skills in architecture, engineering and DevOps teams.

### Previous Experience

Previously I was at HCL Cloud Native Labs, beginning as a Cloud Native Solutions Expert helping organisations move to the cloud. I progressed to lead the IBM Red Hat Ecosystem and then to be the cross-ecosystem Head of Solutions Architecture. This experience gave me a broad exposure to the potential and challenges of cloud offerings with many customers.

The main areas where I have been able to provide value are increasing developer productivity and reducing operations overhead. I also have a strong interest in software sustainability in the cloud and moving towards net-zero, and I am a member of the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new window)</span> and a [Green Software Champion](https://champions.greensoftware.foundation/champions/daniel-vaughan/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new window)</span>.

Before HCL, I spent eight years in Bioinformatics at the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new window)</span> in Cambridge where I started as a Software Engineer, moved into leading engineering teams and developed my cloud skills. At EMBL-EBI, my main interest was software quality and developer productivity.

## Community Involvement

I am particularly passionate about community and skills development. I founded the Genome Campus Software Community and EMBL-EBI Technical Seminars Programme to bring people together to share their ideas, expertise and perspectives. I am currently an organiser of the [Software Crafters Cambridge](https://www.meetup.com/cambridge-software-crafters/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new window)</span> and [GDG Cloud Cambridge](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-cloud-cambridge/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new window)</span> Meetup groups.

## Personal

In my personal life, I live in Saffron Walden with my wife Michelle and son Alex.
