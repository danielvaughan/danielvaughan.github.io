Iâ€™m Daniel Vaughan. I love creating software that people value and enabling others to do the same.

I enable teams to deliver business value through software, quickly and sustainably. The majority of my current work is on cloud-native platforms.

I work as a Cloud-native Solutions Expert at HCL Cloud Native Labs based in central London. 

I previously worked at the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk) in Cambridge, UK where amongst other roles I was Technical Lead for the Ingestion component of the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org) [Data Coordination Platform](https://www.humancellatlas.org/data-sharing).
            
I work with many technologies including Java, Spring, Go and a bit of Python. I have a broad exposure public and private Cloud Platforms day-to-day based on Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry, and a range of databases and infrastructure.

I am particularly passionate about community and skills development. I founded the [Genome Campus Software Community ](https://www.meetup.com/Genome-Campus-Software-Craftsmanship-Community) and EMBL-EBI Technical Seminars Programme, bringing people together to share their ideas and expertise. I am an advocate of the benefits technology brings but also mindful of the challenges it can cause and seek out many perspectives.

Other professional interests include futurism especially around the future of work and automation.
