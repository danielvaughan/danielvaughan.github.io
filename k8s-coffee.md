No agenda, no RSVPs just drop in and chat over coffee.

Each Tuesday he [Kubernetes Podcast](https://kubernetespodcast.com/) releases a new episode. This has a comprehensive news section at the beginning. Listening to this will get you up-to-speed with the latest Kubernetes developments and may give you ideas for discussion.
